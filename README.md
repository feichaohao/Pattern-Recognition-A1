# Pattern-Recognition-A1
We will apply discriminant analysis to recognize the digits in the MNIST data set (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). As a bonus problem we will construct "Fisher digits". We will train our model using the training data sets ("train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz" and "train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz") and test the performance using the test data set ("t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz" and "t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz")
